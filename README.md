# Drive-Photo-Cleaner

## Idea 
- We all have experienced drive shortage, the main reason being google photos upload. 
- What if we have a cleaner which automatically deletes the duplicate photos and blurry photos from a specified folder link which will be uploaded in the flask application.

## Instructions 
- Note: To use it yourself all you've to do is maintain a .json file for your account which you can download from google cloud console 
- After downloading you've to specify the file name in line 102 of `app.py` which is maintained by variable "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE"
